<h2>MALAHIDE CASTLE, COUNTY OF DUBLIN.</h2>

<p>An ancient baronial castle, in good preservation and still inhabited
by the lineal descendant of its original founder, is a
rare object to find in Ireland; and the causes which have led
to this circumstance are too obvious to require an explanation.
In Malahide Castle we have, however, a highly interesting
example of this kind; for though in its present state
it owes much of its imposing effect to modern restorations and
improvements, it still retains a considerable portion of very
ancient date, and most probably even some parts of the original
castle erected in the reign of King Henry II. Considered
in this way, Malahide Castle is without a rival in interest,
not only in our metropolitan county, but also perhaps
within the boundary of the old English pale.</p>

<p>The Castle of Malahide is placed on a gently elevated situation
on a limestone rock near the village or town from
which it derives its name, and of which, with its picturesque
bay, it commands a beautiful prospect. In its general form
it is quadrangular and nearly approaching to a square, flanked
on its south or principal front by circular towers, with a fine
“Gothic” entrance porch in the centre. Its proportions are
of considerable grandeur, and its picturesqueness is greatly
heightened by the masses of luxuriant ivy which mantle its
walls. For much of its present architectural magnificence it
is however indebted to its present proprietor, and his father,
the late Colonel Talbot. The structure, as it appeared in
the commencement of the last century, was of contracted dimensions,
and had wholly lost its original castellated character,
though its ancient moat still remained. This moat is
however now filled up, and its sloping surface is converted
into a green-sward, and planted with Italian cypresses and
other evergreens.</p>

<p>Interesting, however, as this ancient mansion is in its exterior
appearance, it is perhaps still more so in its interior features.
Its spacious hall, roofed with timber-work of oak, is
of considerable antiquity; but its attraction is eclipsed by
another apartment of equal age and vastly superior beauty,
with which indeed in its way there is nothing, as far as we
know, to be compared in Ireland. This unique apartment is
wainscotted throughout with oak elaborately carved, in compartments,
with subjects derived from scripture history, and
though Gothic in their general character, some of them are
executed with considerable skill; while the chimney-piece,
which exhibits in its central division figures of the Virgin and
Child, is carved with a singular degree of elegance and beauty.
The whole is richly varnished, and from the blackness of tint
which the wood has acquired from time, the apartment, as
Mr Brewer well observes, assumes the resemblance of one
vast cabinet of ebony.</p>

<p>The other apartments, of which there are ten on each floor,
are of inferior architectural pretensions, though some of them
are of lofty and spacious proportions. But they are not without
attractions of a high order, being enriched with some
costly specimens of porcelain, and their walls covered with
the more valuable ornaments of a collection of original portraits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and paintings by the old masters. Among the former
the most remarkable are portraits of Charles I. and Queen
Henrietta Maria, by Vandyke; James II. and his queen, Anne
Hyde, by Sir Peter Lely; Queen Anne, by Sir Godfrey Kneller;
the Duchess of Portsmouth, mistress to Charles II.; the
first Duke of Richmond (son of the above duchess) when a
child; Richard Talbot, the celebrated Duke of Tirconnel,
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, general and minister to James II.,
by Sir Peter Lely; the Ladies Catherine and Charlotte Talbot,
daughters of the duke, by Sir P. Lely; with many other
portraits of illustrious members of the Talbot family. The
portraits of the Duchess of Portsmouth and her son were presented
by herself to Mrs Wogan of Rathcoffy, from whom
they were inherited by Colonel Talbot.</p>

<p>Among the pictures of more general interest, the most distinguished
is a small altar piece divided into compartments,
and representing the Nativity, Adoration, and Circumcision.
This most valuable and interesting picture is the work of
Albert Durer, and is said to have belonged to the unfortunate
Mary Queen of Scots. It was purchased by Charles II. for
£2000, and was given by him to the Duchess of Portsmouth,
who presented it to the grandmother of the late Col. Talbot.</p>

<p>As already observed, the noble family of Talbot have been
seated in their present locality for a period of nearly seven
hundred years! According to the pedigree of the family,
drawn up with every appearance of accuracy by Sir William
Betham, Richard Talbot, the second son of Richard Talbot,
Lord of Eccleswell and Linton, in Herefordshire, who was
living in 1153, having accompanied King Henry II. into Ireland,
obtained from that monarch the lordship of Malahide,
being part of the two cantreds of Leinster, in the neighbourhood
of Dublin, which King Henry had reserved, when he
granted the rest of the province to Richard Earl of Strongbow,
to be held as a noble fief of the crown of England. It
is at all events certain, as appears from the chartulary or register
of Mary’s Abbey, now in the British Museum, that this
Richard Talbot granted to St Mary’s Abbey in Dublin certain
lands called Venenbristen, which lie between Croscurry
and the lands of Hamon Mac Kirkyl, in pure and perpetual
alms, that the monks there might pray for the health of his
soul and that of his brother Roger, and their ancestors; and
that he also leased certain lands in Malahide and Portmarnoc
to the monks of the same abbey. From this Richard Talbot
the present Lord Talbot de Malahide descends in the twentieth
generation, and in the twenty-fourth from Richard Talbot,
a Norman baron who held Hereford Castle in the time
of the Conqueror. The noble Earls of Shrewsbury and Talbot
are of the same stock, but descend from Gilbert, the elder
brother of Richard, who was Lord of Eccleswell and Linton,
and was living in 1190.</p>

<p>There can be no question, therefore, of the noble origin of
the Talbots de Malahide, nor can their title be considered
as a mushroom one, though only conferred upon the mother
of the present lord; for Sir William Betham shows that his
ancestor, Thomas Talbot, knight and lord of Malahide, who
had livery of his estate in 1349, was summoned by the sheriff
of Dublin to the Magnum Concilium, or Great Council,
held in Dublin in 1372, 46 Edward III., and again to the Magnum
Concilium held on Saturday, in the vigils of the holy
Trinity, 48 Edward III., 1374, by special writ directed to
himself by the name of “<i>Thome Talbot, Militis</i>.” He was
also summoned by writ to the Parliament of Ireland in the
same year. If therefore it could be ascertained that this
Thomas Talbot actually took his seat under that writ, it
would be clear that his lineal heir-male and heir-general, the
present baron, has a just claim to the honours and dignity
which he has so recently acquired.</p>

<p>The manor of Malahide was created by charter as early
as the reign of King Henry II., and its privileges were confirmed
and enlarged by King Edward IV. in 1475. This, we
believe, still remains in the possession of the chief of the family,
but various other extensive possessions of his ancestors
passed to junior branches of his house, and have been long
alienated from his family.</p>

<p>Among the most memorable circumstances of general interest
connected with the history of this castle and its possessors,
should be mentioned what Mr Brewer properly calls
“a lamentable instance of the ferocity with which quarrels of
party rivalry were conducted in ages during which the internal
polity of Ireland was injuriously neglected by the supreme
head of government:&mdash;On Whitsun-eve, in the year 1329, as
is recorded by Ware, John de Birmingham, Earl of Louth,
Richard Talbot, styled Lord of Malahide, and many of their
kindred, together with sixty of their English followers, were
slain in a pitched battle at Balbriggan [Ballybragan] in
this neighbourhood, by the Anglo-Norman faction of the De
Verdons, De Gernons, and Savages: the cause of animosity
being the election of the earl to the palatinate dignity of
Louth, the county of the latter party.”</p>

<p>At a later period the Talbots of Malahide had a narrow
escape from a calamity nearly as bad as death itself&mdash;the
total loss of their rank and possessions. Involved of necessity
by their political and religious principles in the troubles of the
middle of the seventeenth century, they could hardly have
escaped the persecution of the party assuming government in
the name of the parliament. John Talbot of Malahide having
been indicted and outlawed for acting in the Irish rebellion,
his castle, with five hundred acres of arable land, was granted
by lease, dated 21st December 1653, for seven years, to the
regicide Miles Corbet, who resided here for several years
after, till, being himself outlawed in turn at the period of the
Restoration, he took shipping from its port for the continent.
More fortunate, however, than the representatives of most
other families implicated in the events of this unhappy period,
Mr Talbot was by the act of explanation in 1665 restored to all
his lands and estates in the county of Dublin, as he had held
the same in 1641, only subject to quit rents. It is said that
during the occupation of Malahide by Corbet it became for a
short time the abode of Cromwell himself; but this statement,
we believe, only rests on popular tradition&mdash;a chronicler which
has been too fond of making similar statements respecting
Irish castles generally, to merit attention and belief.</p>

<p>Our limits will not permit us on the present occasion to
enter on any description of the picturesque ruins of the ancient
chapel and tombs situated within the demesne, and immediately
adjacent to the castle; and we shall only add in
conclusion, that the grounds of the demesne, though of
limited extent, and but little varied in elevation, are judiciously
laid out, and present among its plantations many scenes
of dignified character and beauty.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">SAINT BRIDGET’S SHAWL,<br />
<span class="smaller">BY T. E., AUTHOR OF “DARBY DOYLE,” ETC.</span></h2>

<p>Amongst the many extraordinary characters with which this
country abounds, such as fools, madmen, onshochs, omadhauns,
hair-brains, crack-brains, and naturals, I have particularly
taken notice of one. His character is rather singular. He
begs about Newbridge, county of Kildare: he will accept of
any thing offered him, except money&mdash;that he scornfully refuses;
which fulfils the old adage, “None but a fool will refuse
money.” His habitation is the ruins of an old fort or ancient
stronghold called Walshe’s Castle, on the road to Kilcullen,
near Arthgarvan, and within a few yards of the river Liffey,
far away from any dwelling. There he lies on a bundle of
straw, with no other covering save the clothes he wears all
day. Many is the evening I have seen this poor crazy creature
plod along the road to his desolate lodging. There is
another stamp of singularity on his character: his name is
Pat Mowlds, but who dare attempt to call him Pat? It must
be Mr Mowlds, or he will not only be offended himself, but
will surely offend those who neglect this respect. In general
he is of a downcast, melancholy disposition, boasts of being
very learned, is much delighted when any one gives him a
ballad or old newspaper. Sometimes he gets into a very
good humour, and will relate many anecdotes in a droll style.</p>

<p>About two years ago, as I happened to be sauntering along
the border of the Curragh, I overtook this solitary being.</p>

<p>“A fine morning, Mr Mowlds,” was my address.</p>

<p>“Yes, sur, thank God, a very fine morning; shure iv we
don’t have fine weather in July, when will we have it?”</p>

<p>“What a great space of ground this is to lie waste&mdash;what
a quantity of provisions it would produce&mdash;what a number of
people it would employ and feed!” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s very thrue, sur; but was it all sown in pittaties,
what would become ov the poor sheep? Shure we want
mutton as well as pittaties&mdash;besides, all the devarshin we have
every year.&mdash;&mdash;Why, thin, maybe ye have e’er an ould newspaper
or ballit about ye?”</p>

<p>I said I had not, but a couple of Penny Journals should be
at his service which I had in my pocket.</p>

<p>“Och, any thing at all that will keep a body amused,
though I have got a great many of them; but among them all
I don’t see any picther or any account of the round tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
ferninst ye; nor any account ov the fire Saint Bridget <em>kept</em> in
night an’ day for six hundred years; nor any thing about the
raison why it was put out; nor any thing about how Saint
Bridget came by this piece ov ground; nor any thing about
the ould Earl ov Kildare, who rides round the Curragh every
seventh year with silver spurs and silver reins to his horse&mdash;God
bless ye, sur, have ye e’er a bit of tobacky?&mdash;there’s not
a word about this poor counthry at all.”</p>

<p>My senses were now driven to anxiety&mdash;I gave him some
tobacco. He then resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Och, an’ faix it’s myself that can tell all about those
things. Shure my grandfather was brother to one of the ould
anshint bards who left him all his books, and he left them to
my mother, who left them to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr Mowlds,” I said, “you must have a perfect
knowledge of those things&mdash;let us hear something of their
contents.”</p>

<p>“Why, thin, shure, sur, I can’t do less. Now, you see, sur,
it’s my fashion like the priests and ministhers goin’ to praich:
they must give a bit ov a text out ov some larned book, and
that’s the way with me. So here goes&mdash;mind the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The seventeenth ov March, on King Dermot’s great table,</div>
<div class="verse">Where ninety-nine beeves were all roast at a time,</div>
<div class="verse">We dhrank to the memory, while we wor able,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Ov Pathrick, the saint ov our nation;</div>
<div class="verse">And gaily wor dhrinkin’, roarin’, shoutin’,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Cead mille faltha, acushla machree.</div>
<div class="verse">There was Cathleen so fair, an’ Elleen so rare!</div>

<div class="verse indent4">County Kildare an’ the sky over it!</div>
<div class="verse indent8">Short grass for ever!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He thus ended with a kick up of his heel which nearly
touched the nape of his neck, and a flourish of his stick at the
same time. Then turning to me he said,</p>

<p>“I am not going to tell you one word about the fire&mdash;I am
going to tell you how Saint Bridget got all this ground. Bad
luck to <em>Black Noll</em> (a name given to Cromwell) with his crew
ov dirty Sasanachs that tore down the church; and if they
could have got on the tower, that would be down also. No
matther&mdash;every dog will have his day. Sit down on this hill
till we have a shaugh ov the dhudheen. In this hill lie buried
all the bones ov the poor fellows that Gefferds killed the time
ov the throuble, peace an’ rest to their souls!”</p>

<p>“But to the story, Mr Mowlds,” I said, as I watched him
with impatience while he readied his pipe with a large pin.</p>

<p>“Well, sur, here goes. Bad luck to this touch, it’s damp:
the rain blew into my pocket t’other night an’ wetted it&mdash;ha,
I have it.</p>

<p>Now, sur, you persave by the words ov my text that a
great feast was kept up every year at the palace of Castledermot
on Saint Pathrick’s day. Nothing was to be seen for
many days before but slaughtering ov bullocks, skiverin’ ov
pullets, rowlin’ in ov barrels, an’ invitin’ all the quolity about
the counthry; nor did the roolocks and spalpeens lag behind&mdash;they
never waited to be axt; all came to lind a frindly hand
at the feast; nor war the kings ov those days above raisin’
the ax to slay a bullock. King O’Dermot was one ov those
slaughtherin’ kings who wouldn’t cringe at the blood ov any
baste.</p>

<p>’Twas on one ov those festival times that he sallied out
with his ax in his hand to show his dexterity in the killin’ way.
The butchers brought him the cattle one afther another, an’
he laid them down as fast as they could be dhrained ov their
blood.</p>

<p>Afther layin’ down ninety-nine, the last ov a hundhred was
brought to him. Just as he riz the ax to give it the clout,
the ox with a sudden chuck drew the stake from the ground,
and away with him over hill an’ dale, with the swingin’ block
an’ a hundred spalpeens at his heels. At last he made into
the river just below Kilcullen, when a little gossoon thought
to get on his back; but his tail bein’ very long, gave a twitch
an’ hitched itself in a black knot round the chap’s body, and
so towed him across the river.</p>

<p>Away with him then across the Curragh, ever till he came
to where Saint Bridget lived. He roared at the gate as if
for marcy. Saint Bridget was just at the door when she saw
the ox with his horns thrust through the bars.</p>

<p>‘Arrah, what ails ye, poor baste?’ sez she, not seein’ the
boy at his tail.</p>

<p>‘Och,’ sez the boy, makin’ answer for the ox, ‘for marcy
sake let me in. I’m the last ov a hundred that was goin’ to
be kilt by King O’Dermot for his great feast to-morrow; but
he little knows who I am.’</p>

<p>Begor, when she heard the ox spake, she was startled; but
rousin’ herself, she said,</p>

<p>‘Why, thin, it ’ud be fitther for King O’Dermot to give me
a few ov yees, than be feedin’ Budhavore: it’s well you come
itself.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but, shure, you won’t kill me, Biddy Darlin,’ sez the
chap, takin’ the hint, as it was nigh dark, and Biddy couldn’t
see him with her odd eye; for you must know, sur, that she
was such a purty girl when she was young, that the boys used
to be runnin’ in dozens afther her. At last she prayed for
somethin’ to keep them from tormenting her. So you see,
sur, she was seized with the small-pox at one side ov her face,
which blinded up her eye, and left the whole side ov her face
in furrows, while the other side remained as beautiful as ever.</p>

<p>‘In troth you needn’t fear me killin’ ye,’ sez she; ‘but
where can I keep ye?’</p>

<p>‘Och,’ says the arch wag, ‘shure when I grow up to be a
bull I can guard yer ground.’</p>

<p>‘Ground, in yeagh,’ sez the saint; ‘shure I havn’t as much
as would sow a ridge ov pittaties, barrin’ the taste I have for
the girls to walk on.’</p>

<p>‘And did you ax the king for nane?’ sed the supposed ox.</p>

<p>‘In troth I did, but the ould budhoch refused me twice’t.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Biddy honey,’ sez the chap, ‘the third offer’s lucky.
Go to-morrow, when he’s at dinner, and you may come at the
soft side ov him. But won’t you give some refreshment to
this poor boy that I picked up on the road? I fear he is dead
or smothered hanging at my tail.’</p>

<p>Well, to be sure, the chap hung his head (moryeah) when
he sed this.</p>

<p>Out St Bridget called a dozen ov nuns, who untied the
knot, and afther wipin’ the chap as clean as a new pin, brought
him into the kitchen, and crammed him with the best of aitin’
and drinkin’; but while they wor doing this, away legged the
ox. St Bridget went out to ax him some questions consarnin’
the king, but he was gone.</p>

<p>‘’Pon my sowkins,’ sed she, ‘but that was a mighty odd
thing entirely. Faix, an it’s myself that will be off to Castledermot
to-morrow, hit or miss.’</p>

<p>Well, sur, the next day she gother together about three
dozen nuns.</p>

<p>‘Toss on yer mantles,’ sez she, ‘an’ let us be off to Castledermot.’</p>

<p>‘With all harts,’ sez they.</p>

<p>‘Come here, Norah,’ sez she to the sarvint maid. ‘Slack
down the fire,’ sez she, ‘and be sure you have the kittle on. I
couldn’t go to bed without my tay, was it ever so late.’</p>

<p>So afther givin’ her ordhers off they started.</p>

<p>Well, behould ye, sur, when she got within two miles ov the
palace, word was brought to the king that St Bridget and
above five hundred nuns were on the road, comin’ to dine with
him.</p>

<p>‘O tundheranounthers,’ roared the king, ‘what’ll I do for
their dinner? Why the dhoul didn’t she come an hour sooner,
or sent word yestherday? Such a time for visithers! Do ye
hear me, Paudeen Roorke?’ sez he, turnin’ to his chief butler:
‘run afther Rory Condaugh, and ax him did he give away the
two hind quarthers that I sed was a little rare.’</p>

<p>‘Och, yer honor,’ sed Paudeen Roorke, ‘shure he gev them
to a parcel of boccochs at the gate.’</p>

<p>‘The dhoul do them good with it! Oh, fire and faggots!
what’ll become ov me?&mdash;shure she will say I have no hospitality,
an’ lave me her curse. But, cooger, Paudeen: did the
roolocks overtake the ox that ran away yestherday?’</p>

<p>‘Och, the dhoul a haugh ov him ever was got, yer honor.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s no matther; that’ll be a good excuse; do you go
and meet her; I lave it all to you to get me out ov this
hobble.’</p>

<p>‘Naboclish,’ said Paudeen Roorke, cracking his fingers, an’
out he started. Just as he got to the door he met her <em>going</em>
to <em>come</em> in. Well become the king, but he shlipt behind the
door to hear what ’ud be sed. ‘Bedhahusth,’ he roared to the
guests that wor going to dhrink his health while his back was
turned.</p>

<p>‘God save yer reverence!’ said St Bridget to the butler,
takin’ him for the king’s chaplain, he had such a grummoch
face on him; ‘can I see the king?’</p>

<p>‘God save you kindly!’ sed Paudeen, ‘to be shure ye can.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Who will I say wants him?’ eyeing the black army at her
heels.</p>

<p>‘Tell him St Bridget called with a few friends to take pot
luck.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, murther!’ sed Paudeen, ‘why didn’t you come an
hour sooner? I’m afraid the meat is all cowld, we waited so
long for ye.’</p>

<p>‘Och, don’t make any <em>bones</em> about it,’ sed St Bridget: ‘it’s
a cowld stummock can’t warm its own mait.’</p>

<p>‘In troth that’s thrue enough,’ sed Paudeen; ‘but I fear
there isn’t enough for so many.’</p>

<p>‘Why, ye set of <i lang="ga">cormorals</i>,’ sed she, ‘have ye swallied the
whole ninety-nine oxen that ye kilt yestherday?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, blessed hour!’ groaned the king to himself, ‘how did
she know that? Och, I suppose she knows I’m here too.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, bad scran to me!’ said Paudeen, ‘but we had the best
and fattest keepin’ for you, but he ran away.’</p>

<p>‘In troth you needn’t tell me that,’ sez she; ‘I know all
about yer doings. If I’m sent away without my dinner itself,
I must see the king.’</p>

<p>Just as she sed this, a hiccup seized the king, so loud that
it reached the great hall. The guests, who war all silent by
the king’s order, thought he sed hip, hip!&mdash;so. Such a shout,
my jewel, as nearly frightened the saint away.</p>

<p>‘In troth,’ sez she, ‘I’d be very sorry to venthur among
such a set of riff-raff, any way. But who’s this behind the
door?’ sez she, cockin’ her eye. ‘Oh, I beg pardon!&mdash;I hope
no inthrusion&mdash;there ye are&mdash;ye’ll save me the trouble ov
goin’ in.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ sed the king (hic), ‘I tuck a little sick in my stummock,
and came down to get fresh air. I beg pardon. Why
didn’t you come in time to dinner?’</p>

<p>‘I want no dinner,’ said she; ‘I came to speak on affairs ov
state.’</p>

<p>‘Why, thin,’ said the king, ‘before ye state them, ye
must come in and take a bit in yer fingers, at any rate.’</p>

<p>‘In troth,’ sez she, ‘I was always used to full and plenty,
and not any scrageen bits; and to think ov a king’s table not
having a flaugooloch meal, is all nonsense: that’s like the
taste ov ground I axt ye for some time ago.’</p>

<p>Begor, sur, when she sed that, she gev him such a start
that the hiccough left him.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Biddy, honey,’ sez he, ‘shure ye wor only passin’ a
joke to cure me: say no more&mdash;it’s all gone.’</p>

<p>Just as he sed this, he heard a great shout at a distance:
out he pulled his specks, an’ put them on his nose; when to
his joy he saw a whole crowd ov spalpeens dhrivin’ the ox before
them. The king, forgettin’ who he was spaikin’ to, took
off his caubeen, and began to wave it, as he ran off to
meet them.</p>

<p>‘Oh! mahurpendhoul, but ye’re brave fellows,’ sez he; ‘who
ever it was that <em>cotch</em> him shall have a commission in my life
guards. I never wanted a joint more. Galong, every mother’s
son ov yees, and horry all the gridirons and frying-pans
ye can get. Hand me the axe, till I have some steaks
tost up for a few friends.’</p>

<p>So, my jewel, while ye’d say thrap-stick, the ox was down,
an’ on the gridirons before the life was half out ov him.</p>

<p>Well, to be shure, St Bridget got mighty hungry, as she
had walked a long way. She then tould the king that the gentlemen
should lave the room, as she could not sit with any one
not in ordhers, and they being a little out ov ordher. So, to
make themselves agreeable to her ordhers, they quit the hall,
and went out to play at hurdles.</p>

<p>When the king recollected who he was goin’ to give dinner
to, sez he to himself, ‘Shure no king ought to be above sarvin’
a saint.’ So over he goes to his wife the queen.</p>

<p>‘Dorah,’ sez he, ‘do ye know who’s within?’ ‘Why, to be
shure I do,’ sez she; ‘ain’t it Bridheen na Keogue?’</p>

<p>‘Ye’re right,’ sez he, ‘and you know she’s a saint; an’ I
think it will be for the good ov our sowls that she kem here
to-day. Come, peel off yer muslins, and help me up wid the
dinner.’</p>

<p>‘In troth I’ll not,’ sez the queen; ‘shure ye know I’m a
black Prospitarian, an’ bleeve nun ov yer saints.’</p>

<p>‘Arrah, nun or yer quare ways,’ sez he; ‘don’t you wish
my sowl happy, any how?&mdash;an’ if you help me, you will be
only helpin’ my sowl to heaven.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, in that case,’ sez she, ‘here’s at ye, and the sooner the
betther. But one charge I’d give ye: take care how ye open
yer <i lang="ga">claub</i> about ground: ye know she thought to come round
ye twice before.’</p>

<p>So in the twinklin’ ov an eye she went down to the kitchen,
an’ put on a prashkeen, an’ was <em>first dish</em> at the table.</p>

<p>The king saw every one lashin’ away at their dinner except
Bridget.</p>

<p>‘Arrah, Biddy, honey,’ sez he, ‘why don’t ye help yerself?’</p>

<p>‘Why, thin,’ sez she, ‘the dhoul a bit, bite or sup, I’ll take
undher yer roof until ye grant me one favour.’</p>

<p>‘And what is that?’ sez the king; ‘shure ye know a king
must stand to his word was it half his kingdom, and how do
I know but ye want to chouse me out ov it: let me know
first what ye want.’</p>

<p>‘Well, thin, Mr King O’Dermot,’ sez she, ‘all I want is a
taste ov ground to sow a few pays in.’</p>

<p>‘Well, an’ how much do ye want, yer reverence,’ sez he, all
over ov a thrimble, betune his wife’s dark looks, and the curse
he expected from Bridget if he refused.</p>

<p>‘Not much,’ sez she, ‘for the present. You don’t know how
I’m situated. All the pilgrims going to Lough Dhearg are
sent to me to put the pays in their brogues, an’ ye know I
havn’t as much ground as would sow a pint; but if ye only
give me about fifty acres, I’ll be contint.’</p>

<p>‘Fifty acres!’ roared the king, stretching his neck like a
goose.</p>

<p>‘Fifty acres!’ roared the queen, knitting her brows; ‘shure
that much ground would fill their pockets as well as their
brogues.’</p>

<p>‘There ye’re out ov it,’ said the saint; ‘why, it wouldn’t be
half enough if they got their dhue according to their sins; but
I’ll lave it to yerself.’</p>

<p>‘How much will ye give?’</p>

<p>‘Not an acre,’ said the queen.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Dorah,’ sed the king, ‘let me give the crathur some.’</p>

<p>‘Not an <em>inch</em>,’ sed the queen, ‘if I’m to be misthress here.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I beg pardon,’ sez the saint; ‘so, Mr King O’Dermot,
you are undher petticoat government I see; but maybe I
won’t match ye for all that. Now, take my word, you shall
go on penance to Lough Dhearg before nine days is about;
and instead ov pays ye shall have pebble stones and swan shot,
in yer brogues. But it’s well for you, Mrs Queen, that ye’re
out ov my reach, or I’d send you there barefooted, with nothing
on but yer stockings.’</p>

<p>When the king heard this, he fell all ov a thrimble. ‘Oh,
Dorah,’ sez he, ‘give the crathur a little taste ov ground to
satisfy her.’</p>

<p>‘No, not as much as she could play ninepins on,’ sez she,
shakin’ her fist and grindin’ her teeth together; ‘and I hope
she may send you to Lough Dhearg, as she sed she would.’</p>

<p>‘Why, thin, have ye no feeling for one ov yer own sex?’
sez the saint. ‘I’ll go my way this minit, iv ye only give me
as much as my shawl will cover.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s a horse ov another colour,’ sez the queen; ‘you
may have that, with a heart and a half. But you know very
well if I didn’t watch that fool ov a man, he’d give the very
nose off his face if a girl only axt him how he was.’</p>

<p>Well, sur, when the king heard this, he grew as merry as a
cricket. ‘Come, Biddy,’ sez he, ‘we mustn’t have a dhry
bargain, any how.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, ye’ll excuse me, Mr King O’Dermot,’ sez she; ‘I never
drink stronger nor wather.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, son ov Fingal,’ exclaimed the king, ‘do ye hear this,
and it Pathrick’s day!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I intirely forgot that,’ sez she. ‘Well, then, for fear
ye’d say I was a bad fellow, I’ll just taste. Shedhurdh.’</p>

<p>Well, sur, after the dhough-an-dheris she went home very
well pleased that she was to get ever a taste ov ground at all,
and she promised the king to make his pinance light, and
that she would boil the pays for him, as she did with young
men ov tendher conshinses; but as to ould hardened sinners,
she’d keep the pays till they’d be as stale as a sailor’s bisket.</p>

<p>Well, to be shure, when she got home she set upwards ov a
hundhred nuns at work to make her shawl, during which time
she was never heard of. At last, afther six months’ hard labour,
they got it finished.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ sez she, ‘it’s time I should go see the king, that he
may come and see that I take no more than my right. So,
taking no one with her barrin’ herself and <em>one</em> nun, off she set.</p>

<p>The king and queen were just sitting down to tay at the
parlour window when she got there.</p>

<p>‘Whoo! talk of the dhoul and he’ll appear,’ sez he. ‘Why,
thin, Biddy honey, it’s an ago since we saw ye. Sit down;
we’re just on the first cup. Dorah and myself were afther
talkin’ about ye, an’ thought ye forgot us intirely. Well, did
ye take that bit ov ground?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Indeed I’d be very sorry to do the likes behind any one’s
back. You must come to-morrow and see it measured.’</p>

<p>‘Not I, ’pon my sowkins,’ sed the king: ‘do ye think me so
mane as to doubt yer word?’</p>

<p>‘Pho! pho!’ sed the queen, ‘such a taste is not worth talkin’
ov; but, just to honour ye, we shall attind in state to-morrow.
Sit down.’</p>

<p>She took up her station betune the king an’ queen: the
purty side ov her face was next the king, an’ the ugly side
next the queen.</p>

<p>‘I can’t be jealous ov you, at any rate,’ sed the queen to herself,
as she never saw her veil off before.</p>

<p>‘Oh, murther!’ sez the king, ‘what a pity ye’re a saint,
and Dorah to be alive. Such a beauty!’</p>

<p>Just as he was starin’, the queen happened to look over at a
looking-glass, in which she saw Biddy’s pretty side.</p>

<p>‘Hem!’ sez she, sippin’ her cup. ‘Dermot,’ sez she, ‘it’s
very much out ov manners to be stuck with ladies at their tay.
Go take a shaugh ov the dhudheen, while we talk over some
affairs ov state.’</p>

<p>Begor, sur, the king was glad ov the excuse to lave them
together, in the hopes St Bridget would convart his wife.</p>

<p>Well, sur, whatever discoorse they had, I disremember,
but the queen came down in great humour to wish the saint
good night, an’ promised to be on the road the next day to
Kildare.</p>

<p>‘Faix,’ sez the saint, ‘I was nigh forgettin’ my gentility to
wish the king good night. Where is he?’</p>

<p>‘Augh, and shure myself doesn’t know, barrin’ he’s in the
kitchen.’</p>

<p>‘In the kitchen!’ exclaimed the saint; ‘oh fie!’</p>

<p>‘Ay, indeed, just cock yer eye,’ sez the queen, ‘to the
key-hole: that dhudheen is his excuse. I can’t keep a maid
for him.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! is that the way with him?&mdash;never fear: I’ll make his
pinance purty sharp for that. At any rate call him out an’
let us part in friends.’</p>

<p>So, sur, afther all the compliments wor passed, the king
sed he should go see her a bit ov the road, as it was late:
so off he went. The moon had just got up, an’ he walked
alongside the saint at the ugly side; but when he looked
round to praise her, an’ pay her a little compliment, he got
sich a fright that he’d take his oath it wasn’t her at all, so he
was glad to get back to the queen.</p>

<p>Well, sur, next morning the queen ordhered the long car to
be got ready, with plenty ov clean straw in it, as in those
times they had no coaches; then regulated her life guards,
twelve to ride before and twelve behind, the king at one side
and the chief butler at the other, for without the butler she
couldn’t do at all, as every mile she had to stop the whole retinue
till she’d get refreshment. In the meantime, St Bridget
placed her nuns twenty-one miles round the Curragh. At
last the thrumpet sounded, which gave notice that the king
was coming. As soon as they halted, six men lifted the queen
up on the throne, which they brought with them on the long
car. The king ov coorse got up by her side.</p>

<p>‘Well, Dorah,’ sez he in a whisper, ‘what a laugh we’ll
have at Biddy, with her shawl!’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know that neither,’ sez the queen. ‘It looks as
thick as Finmocool’s boulsther, as it hangs over her shoulder.’</p>

<p>‘God save yer highness,’ sed the saint, as she kem up to
them. ‘Why, ye sted mighty long. I had a snack ready for
ye at one o’clock.’</p>

<p>‘Och, it’s no matther,’ sez the queen; ‘measure yer bit ov
ground, and we then can have it in comfort.’</p>

<p>So with that St Bridget threw down her shawl, which she
had cunningly folded up.</p>

<p>Now, sur, this shawl was made ov fine sewin’ silk, all network,
each mesh six feet square, and tuck thirty-six pounds
ov silk, and employed six hundred and sixty nuns for three
months making it.</p>

<p>Well, sur, as I sed afore, she threw it on the ground.</p>

<p>‘Here, Judy Conway, run to Biddy Conroy with this corner,
an’ let her make aff in the direckshin ov Kildare, an’ be
shure she runs the corner into the <em>mon’stery</em>. Here, you, Nelly
Murphy, make off to Kilcullen; an’ you, Katty Farrel, away
with you to Ballysax; an’ you, Nelly Doye, away to Arthgarvan;
an’ you, Rose Regan, in the direckshin of Connell;
an’ you, Ellen Fogarty, away in the road to Maddenstown;
an’ you, Jenny Purcel, away to Airfield. Just hand it from
one to t’other.’</p>

<p>So givin’ three claps ov her hand, off they set like hounds,
an’ in a minnit ye’d think a haul ov nuns wor cotched in the
net.</p>

<p>‘Oh, millia murther!’ sez the queen, ‘she’s stretchin’ it over
my daughter’s ground.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, blud-an’-turf!’ sez the king, ‘now she’s stretchin’ it
over my son’s ground. Galong, ye set ov <i lang="ga">thaulabawns</i>,’ sed
he to his life-guards; ‘galong, I say, an’ stop her, else she’ll
cover all my dominions.’</p>

<p>‘Oh fie, yer honour,’ sez the chief butler; ‘if you break
yer word, I’m not shure ov my wages.’</p>

<p>Well behould ye, sur, in less than two hours Saint Bridget
had the whole Curragh covered.</p>

<p>‘Now see what a purty kittle of fish you’ve made ov it!’
sez the queen.</p>

<p>‘No, but it’s you, Mrs Queen O’Dermot, ’twas you agreed
to this.’</p>

<p>‘Ger out, ye ould bosthoon,’ sez the queen, ‘ye desarve it
all: ye might aisy guess that she’d chouse ye. Shure iv ye
had a grain ov sinse, ye might recollect how yer cousin King
O’Toole was choused by Saint Kavin out ov all his ground,
by the saint stuffin’ a lump ov a crow into the belly ov the
ould goose.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Dorah, never mind; if she makes a hole, I have a peg
for it. Now, Biddy,’ sez he, ‘though I gave ye the ground, I
forgot to tell ye that I only give it for a certain time. I now
tell ye from this day forward you shall only have it while ye
keep yer fire in.’”</p>

<p>Here I lost the remainder of his discourse by my ill manners.
I got so familiar with Mr Mowlds, and so interested
with his story, that I forgot my politeness.</p>

<p>“And what about the fire, <span class="smcap">Pat</span>?” said I, without consideration.</p>

<p>Before I could recollect the offence, he turned on me with
the eyes of a maniac&mdash;</p>

<p>“The dhoul whishper nollege into your ear. <em>Pat!</em>&mdash;(hum)&mdash;<em>Pat!</em>&mdash;<em>Pat!</em>&mdash;this
is freedom, with all my heart.”</p>

<p>So saying, he strode away, muttering something between his
teeth. However, I hope again to meet him, when I shall be a
little more cautious in my address.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE ELECTROTYPE.</h2>

<p>An elaborate and very lucid article on the Electrotype and
Daguerreotype, being a review of “An Account of Experiments
in Electricity made by Thomas Spencer&mdash;Annals of
Electricity, January 1840,” and of the account of M. Daguerre’s
discovery of Photogenic Drawing as published by
himself, has appeared in that excellent work “The Westminster
Review” for September. Our space not allowing
us to enter so fully into details as our admirable contemporary,
we present our readers with as concise an article as
the nature of the subject will permit, confining ourselves for
the present to the Electrotype, as being less generally known,
though not less curious.</p>

<p>The electrotype is another instance of the application of invisible
elements to the uses of man, by which powers and influences,
of whose nature he is as yet wholly ignorant, are made
subservient to his purposes, and obedient to his rule.</p>

<p>To define accurately what electricity is, would be, as yet at
least, impossible. Many conjectures have been, are, and will
be hazarded, but the knowledge of its production, power, and
effects, is only in its infancy, and so full of promise of a gigantic
growth, that time will be better spent in its cultivation
than in debating upon what it is.</p>

<p>The truth of this proposition is fully borne out by the subject
of our present paper; for whilst many scientific men have
been exhausting their energies in the production of plausible
theories upon the nature of the electric fluid, other more
matter-of-fact philosophers have addressed themselves to its
application; and whilst some of these devote themselves to
the developement of its motive powers, in the well-founded hope
of its superseding steam, others press its services to far different
uses. Amongst the last, Mr Spencer holds a foremost
place.</p>

<p>Before entering into the description of the electrotype, we
must say a few words on the subject of electricity to the less
informed of our readers. The electric fluid, as it is called,
may be produced in various ways: the most ordinary is by
the friction of glass against silk, as exemplified in the electrical
machine, which is familiar to almost every one. But
galvanic and voltaic electricity is differently produced. In
all cases its production is the consequence of combination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
but particularly in the galvanic battery and voltaic circle.
The latter, being Mr Spencer’s apparatus, we shall briefly
describe.</p>

<p>An ordinary voltaic circle is formed by a plate of zinc and
another of copper being placed upright in a vessel containing
acid or a saline solution. Zinc is more oxidisable than copper,
that is, it has a greater affinity to, or inclination to unite itself
with, the gas called oxygen, the combination of which with
the particles of metal produces that appearance which is called
“rust.” Whilst the zinc and copper are separate, the oxygen
of the fluid operates upon both; but if they are united by
means of a wire connected with each, the oxygen forsakes the
copper altogether, and proceeds with increased force to unite
with the zinc, and a current of electricity is immediately
formed, which proceeds from the zinc plate through the fluid
medium to the copper, thence along the connecting wire to the
zinc, and thence round again in a constant circulating stream,
until the zinc has been entirely decomposed, or oxidised.</p>

<p>Electricity being thus produced by combination, its progress
and effects are marked by a wonderful power of separation
or decomposition, which it exerts upon substances brought
within the circle; and this is the power which Mr Spencer has
turned to his use, the great object which he has at present in
view being the multiplication of engraved plates of copper for
the purpose of printing from.</p>

<p>Every person who has seen metal of any description in a
state of fusion, must have remarked that it never forms a
thin fluid such as water, capable of insinuating itself into the
smallest interstices, but is what would be called <em>thick</em> even at
the fiercest heat, consequently incapable of entering into such
fine scratches as are necessary to be accurately and clearly
defined upon an engraved plate. Again, the contraction and
expansion of all metals by the application of heat and cold,
would offer an almost insuperable bar to the utility of casting,
even if the fusion could be rendered perfect. But the application
of electricity removes all the inconveniences, and opens
a new field of science.</p>

<p>Mr Spencer’s apparatus consists of an earthenware vessel,
in which is suspended another, much smaller, of earthenware
or wood, with a bottom formed of plaster-of-Paris. Into the
larger vessel is poured a saturated solution of copper (the
copper being dissolved in sulphuric acid) sufficient to rise up
along the sides of the lesser one, which is filled with the acid
or saline solution intended to operate upon the zinc. The
plaster-of-Paris being very porous, allows the two liquids to
meet in its cells, but prevents them from mixing; by permitting
them to meet, however, the current of electricity is enabled
to circulate through all. In the larger vessel, and beneath
the bottom of the smaller one, is placed the copper plate
from which the cast is to be taken, or upon which the pattern
is to be raised. It is suspended by the wire, which is to connect
it with the zinc, being fixed on the edge of the inner
vessel, in which is the zinc plate, suspended by its connecting
wire. The two wires are then brought into contact, fixed
together by a screw, and the voltaic circle is complete. The
acid in the upper vessel attacks the zinc, the electric current
descends through the plaster bottom, thence through the solution
of copper, where its separating or decomposing power is
brought into operation, causing the infinitely minute particles
of copper suspended in the solution to separate from the sulphuric
acid, and descend upon the plate, through which itself
proceeds to the wire, and so round again.</p>

<p>Now, here is probably the most wonderful part of the process.
It is only on the copper plate that the particles of copper,
disengaged from the solution, will descend and settle. If
the copper be varnished, or covered with a coat of wax, they
will not deposit themselves or go together at all; but where
they find the clean surface of the metal, they at once not only
settle, but fix and adjust themselves in their proper forms,
building up as it were a metal structure, not eccentric or uneven,
but forming a correct plate of new metal, so pure, so
hard, and so free from defect or extraneous matter, that
engravers prefer copper plates thus formed to any other for
working upon. But the perfection of this operation consists
in the wonderful accuracy with which the finest lines of the
most beautiful engravings are copied: the particles which
float in the solution are so indefinitely small, that they can
enter into the finest cuts, the slightest scratches; and as they
undergo no process of heating or cooling, their form is in nowise
altered.</p>

<p>We have already observed, that if the plate of metal be
covered, even with varnish, the particles will not descend or
form upon it; nevertheless, if some slight substance be not
interposed, the depositing particles adhere so firmly to it as
to be inseparable, and it is upon this property that one of the
processes&mdash;that of engraving in relief on a plate of copper&mdash;entirely
depends for success. When a cast of an engraved
plate is required, the plate must be coated with bee’s-wax,
mixed with a little spirits of turpentine. It is laid on the
plate in a lump and melted, and when just cooling is wiped off,
when, although apparently clean, enough remains to interpose
between the new and original plates, and prevent a too strong
cohesion. It is not necessary that the engraved plate should
be copper: it may be for instance lead or type metal, in which
case it need not be waxed, as the application of heat, expanding
the metals unequally, causes them at once to start asunder.</p>

<p>A piece of wire having been soldered to the back of the plate,
its back and edges should be covered with a double coat of thick
varnish, or it may be embedded in a box with plaster-of-Paris
or Roman cement. This precaution is necessary, to prevent
the plate from being inclosed, and to limit the deposition to a
proper extent.</p>

<p>It may now be suspended in the apparatus, and the wires
being placed in contact, the operation begins. Particle by
particle the new metal is formed, until the plate is of sufficient
thickness, when it is withdrawn, and heat being applied, the
two plates are separated, one being the exact counterpart, in
relief, of the other. Care must be taken in all cases to change
the solution of copper frequently, for by merely <em>adding</em>, the
separated particles of the sulphuric acid would accumulate
to such extent as to mar or injure the operation.</p>

<p>From the plate thus formed in relief, as many casts as may
be required can be obtained, by making it the mould.</p>

<p>To copy or multiply medals and coins the operation is very
simple, for a mould can be easily obtained by compressing
the medal or coin between two plates of milled sheet lead, and by
varnishing the lead round the impression, the deposit will be
formed in the hollow only; and for this purpose a very simple
apparatus will suffice, and one that may be very easily made.
For the outer vessel an ordinary glass tumbler or finger-bowl
will answer; and for the inner, a cylindrical gas-glass, having
a bottom made of plaster-of-Paris. The solution of copper
being in the tumbler, and the acid with the zinc in the gas-glass,
the mould should be suspended by its conducting wire
between the bottoms, the wire of the zinc connected with it,
and the operation will proceed. In all cases it must be observed
that the edge of the mould should be up, as, if it be
placed horizontally, extraneous substances, sinking by their
own weight, may be deposited upon it.</p>

<p>To produce a raised design upon a plate of copper, or as it
is rather erroneously styled, “Engraving in Relief,” the operation
is thus performed:&mdash;</p>

<p>The plate upon which the design is to be raised having had
the conducting wire soldered to it, is covered with a coat of
wax about one-eighth of an inch or less in thickness, and upon
the surface of this coat the design is drawn. With a graver,
the end of which must be of the form of a thin parallelogram,
so as to make grooves in the wax equally broad at the bottom
as at the top, the lines of the drawing are to be carefully cut
down to the plate; care being taken that the plate is perfectly
cleaned throughout each line, and also that the grooves
are not narrower at the bottom than at the top. In order to
lay the surface of the copper at the bottom of the grooves perfectly
bare, the plate must be immersed in diluted nitric acid
(three parts of water to one of acid), and the particles of wax
that may have escaped the graver are driven off by the fumes
of the acid. The plate is then placed in the apparatus, the
circle closed as before, and the operation commences. As the
particles of copper require a metallic base, they avoid the wax
and seek the metal in the grooves; they there attach themselves
to it, and to each other, until the hollows are quite filled up,
when the plate is removed. If the surfaces of the ridges thus
built up be not perfectly smooth, a piece of pumice stone or
smooth flag, with water, being rubbed to them, will soon reduce
them, after which the wax can be melted and cleaned off
with spirits of turpentine; and so firm is this formation of
metal thus raised, both in the adherence of its particles to
each other and to the original plate, that it may be printed
from at any ordinary printing-press.</p>

<p>One general remark applies to the production of electrotype
copper, and it is, that the strength and solidity of the formation
depends upon the slowness and deliberation of the process.
The more slowly and deliberately the particles separate
from the solution and proceed to their places, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
fitly they appear to take them up, and the more firmly they
adhere; whilst on the contrary, if the operation be hurried, the
metal is brittle, so much so as sometimes to powder under an
ordinary pressure. The thicker and finer the partition of
plaster between the two fluids, the more slightly are they
connected, and consequently the slower is the circulation of
the electricity. The proper length of time to be allowed for
the process varies according to the nature of the work, and
the strength or solidity required. Forty-eight hours seems to
be the least time for forming a design in relief, and somewhat
more than a week for a plate with sunk lines.</p>

<p>The laws which govern matter are mysterious. The entire
of this process is so wonderful, that to descant upon it
would be unnecessary; and, after all, it is but another step
taken upon the path of science, each advance upon which,
whilst disclosing new scenes and greater wonders, is only the
needful preliminary to another which will display yet more!</p>

<h2 class="gap4">FINE LADS.</h2>

<p>We have a mortal aversion to fine lads. And, wherefore,
pray? Why, because in nine cases out of ten, if not positively
in every case, they are the dullest and most insipid of
all human beings: they are good, inoffensive creatures, certainly,
but oh, they are dreadful bores! If you doubt it, just
you take an hour of a fine lad’s company, with nobody present
but yourselves. Shut yourself up in a room with him for that
space of time, and if you don’t ever after, as long as you live,
stand in dread and awe of the society of fine lads, you must
be differently constituted from other men, and amongst other
rare gifts must possess that of being bore-proof.</p>

<p>But, pray, what after all <em>is</em> a fine lad? To the possession
of what quality or qualities is he indebted for this very amiable
sort of character?</p>

<p>Why, these are questions which, like many others, are
much more easily put than answered. But, speaking from
our own knowledge and experience, we should say that it is
not the presence, but the absence&mdash;the entire absence of every
quality, good, bad, and indifferent, that constitutes the fine
lad; and hence his intolerable insipidity.</p>

<p>The fine lad is a blank, a cipher, a vacuum, a nonentity, a
ring without a circumference, a footless stocking without a
leg. In disposition he is neither sweet, sour, nor bitter; in
temper, neither hot nor cold; in spirit, neither merry nor sad.
He is in fact, so far as any thing positive can be said of him,
a mere concentration of negatives. In person he is neither
long nor short, neither fat nor lean, neither stout nor slender.
There must in short be a total absence of all meaning, all
expression, all character, in the happy individual whom every
body will agree in calling a fine lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the fine lad and the world the matter stands thus:
the latter finding him destitute of all distinctive characteristics,
is greatly at a loss what to make of him. It cannot in
conscience call him clever, and it does not like to say he is an
ass, so it good-naturedly calls him a fine lad, taking shelter
in the vagueness and indefiniteness of the term, since nobody
can say precisely what a fine lad really means. Unlike most
other reputations, that of the fine lad is wholly undisputed:
it is generally bestowed on him by universal consent&mdash;no dissentient
voice&mdash;every body agrees in calling him a fine lad.
This is well, and must be a source of great comfort and satisfaction
to the fine lad himself.</p>

<p>We have stated that nobody can say precisely what a fine
lad really is, and this is true, generally speaking. But there
is notwithstanding some degree of meaning attached to the
term: it means, so far as it means any thing, a soft, meek, simpering,
unresisting creature, who will allow himself to be
kicked and cuffed about by any body and every body without
resenting it, and who will take quietly any given quantity
of abuse you choose to heap upon him. This we imagine to
be the true reason why people call him a fine lad, just because
he offers them, whether right or wrong, no resistance; hence
it is too, we have no doubt, that he is so general a favourite.</p>

<p>As most people have a great fancy for having as much of
their own way as possible, and as they find themselves much
jostled and opposed in the indulgence of this laudable propensity
by those who are bent on having the same enjoyment,
they are delighted when they meet with one who readily
makes way for them, and reward his simplicity by clapping
him on the head, and calling him a fine lad.</p>

<p>The fine lad is a goose, poor fellow&mdash;no doubt of it&mdash;a decided
goose, but he cannot help that: it is no fault of his;
he means well, and is a most civil and obliging creature&mdash;all
smiles and good nature. Being in reality good for little or
nothing, having no activity, no tact whatever of any kind, the
fine lad would in most cases be rather ill off as regards his
temporalities, but for his steadiness. He is generally steady,
and of sober and regular habits; and this, together with his
extremely civil demeanour and inoffensive disposition, helps
him on, and secures him in comfortable and respectable
bread. You will thus for the most part find the fine lad in a
well-doing way&mdash;in a good situation probably, and with every
prospect of advancement. His employer likes him for his
integrity and docility. He confesses that he is by no means
clever, in fact that he is rather stupid; but, then, he is a fine
lad. This character he gives him to every body, and every
body acknowledges its justice, and calls him a fine lad too.</p>

<p>Fine lads are in great favour with the ladies, and no wonder,
for fine lads are remarkably attentive to them: they
make the best of all beaus. Thus it is that you are sure to
find at least one fine lad at every tea party you go to. You
know him at once by his soft speech and maiden-like smile,
and by the readiness with which he undertakes, and the quiet
gentleness with which he performs, the task of handing about
the tea-bread, and discharging the other little duties of the
occasion. At all this sort of work the fine lad is unapproachable&mdash;it
is his element&mdash;here, if nowhere else, he shines
resplendent. High in favour, however, as fine lads are with
the fair sex, we have sometimes thought that there was fully
more of esteem than admiration in the feeling with which
they contemplate his character. They like his society, and
have at all times their softest words and blandest smiles
ready for him; but we much doubt if he is just the sort of man
they would choose for a husband. We rather think not. We
suspect they see in his nature something too much akin to
their own, to allow of their ever thinking of him in the light
of a protector.</p>

<p>The fine lad, however, <em>does</em> get married sometimes, and in
justice to him, we are bound to say, always makes an excellent
husband. He is gentle, kind, and indulgent: for the fine
lad generally remains, in spirit at least, a fine lad to the last.
So the ladies had better take this into consideration, having
our authority for so doing, and henceforth look on fine lads
with more seriousness than they have hitherto done.</p>

<p class="right">C.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Fidelity.</span>&mdash;This virtue is displayed in the fulfilment of
promises, whether expressed or implied, in the conscientious
scrupulous discharge of the duties of friendship, and in the
keeping of secrets. It is therefore a great virtue, and may
be used as a decisive test of character. He who has it is
entitled to confidence and respect; he who lacks it merits
contempt. If a man carefully performs his promises, may we
not confide in him? If he violates them, must we not despise
him? If we find a person is true to friendship, we may be
sure that he has just perceptions of virtue. If we find one
who betrays a friend, or who is guilty of any species of treachery,
we cannot doubt that he is essentially base and corrupt.
To those who cannot keep a secret, we commend an anecdote
of Charles II. of England, which ought to be engraved upon
the heart of every man. When importuned to communicate
something of a private nature, the subtle monarch said, “Can
you keep a secret?” “Most faithfully,” returned the nobleman.
“So can I,” was the laconic and severe answer of the
king. Let parents, who desire that their children should possess
the respect of the community and enjoy the pleasures of
friendship, take care to imbue them with fidelity of character.&mdash;<cite>Fireside
Education, by S. G. Goodrich.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Anecdote.</span>&mdash;“Guzzling Pete,” a half-witted country wight,
and the town’s jest, came home one rainy Saturday night so
“darkly, deeply, beautifully <em>blue</em>,” that he went to bed with
his hat and boots on, and his old cotton umbrella under his
arm. He got up about two o’clock the next afternoon, drunk
with last night, and took his way to the meeting-house. Rev.
Dr B&mdash;&mdash; was at his “17thly” in the second of six divisions
of a very comprehensive body of Hopkinsian divinity, when
“Guzzling Pete” entered the church with an egg in each hand.
He saw as through a glass darkly, and with evident commiseration,
a man in black, very red in the face, for the day was oppressively
warm, who seemed to utter something with a great
deal of vehemence, while a considerable number of those underneath
him were fast asleep&mdash;among them Deacon C&mdash;&mdash;, with
his shiny-bald head leaning against the wall. Pete, unobserved
by the minister, balanced his egg, and with tolerable aim plastered
its contents directly above the deacon’s pate! Hearing
the concussion, the worthy divine paused in his discourse, and
looked daggers at the maudlin visitor. “Never mind, uncle,”
exclaimed the intruder: “jest you go on a-talkin’&mdash;<em>I’ll keep
’em awake for you!</em>” By this time the congregation were thoroughly
aroused. “Mr L&mdash;&mdash;,” said the reverend pastor,
with a seeming charity, which in his mortification he could
scarcely have felt, and addressing a “tiding-man” near the
door, “Mr L&mdash;&mdash;, won’t you have the kindness to remove that
poor creature from the aisle? I fear that he is sick.” “<em>Sick!</em>”
stammered our qualmish hero, as he began to confirm the fears
of the clergyman by very active symptoms; “<em>s-i-c-k!</em>&mdash;yes,
and it’s enough to make a <em>dog</em> sick to sit under such stupid
preachin’ as your’n: it’s more’n I can <em>stand</em> under! Yes,
take me out&mdash;the quicker the better!”</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">The Ass.</span>&mdash;The ass performs so many useful duties besides
his <em>choragic</em> functions in our community, that he cannot be
respectfully omitted. He is called a bad vocalist, though some
amateurs prefer him to the mule; but he is perhaps underrated.
There are many notes which alone are shocking to
the ear, that have in concert an agreeable harmony. The
gabble of the goose is not unpleasant in the orchestra of the
barn-yard, and there are many instances, no doubt, in which
braying would improve harmony. If one looks close into
nature, he will find nothing, not even the gargle of the frog-pond,
created in vain. At Musard’s they often improve the
spirit of a gallopade by the sudden clank and crash of a chain
upon a hollow platform, with now and then a scream like the
war-whoop of the Seminoles. What the Italians understand,
and what most other nations do not, is the harmonious composition
of discordant sounds. If a general concert of nature
could be formed, the crow as well as the nightingale would be
necessary to the perfect symphony; and it is likely even the
file and hand-saw might be made to discourse excellent music.
But even in a solo, the ass, according to Coleridge, has his
merits. He has certainly the merit of execution. He commences
with a few prelusive notes, gently, as if essaying his
organs, rising in a progressive swell to enthusiasm, and then
gradually dies away to a pathetic close; an exact prototype
of the best German and Italian compositions, and a living
sanction of the genuine and authentic instructions of the Academie
de Musique.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
